# i-Ready Cheats Decompiled
 
* A decompilation of some i-Ready cheats.
* Cheats are patched, but are decompiled to better understand how they work.
* Documentation might be provided. You can steal the GUI from here if you want.
* Documentation for how to find hooks and make cheats will not be possible as of now.

# Some Notes

* This decompilation is mainly usable and somewhat messy.
* Used JSNice for some of the weaker obfuscated ones that don't confuse JSNice
* message from orphan here, i'm still trying to learn javascript, so take some of the decompiled code with a grain of salt compared to the original. removed a bunch of original code to make it work however
* Nullify 6.9 contains lots of dead code, and a skipper that caused a headache. There's 2 dragElements, and the menu won't drag anyway, so it's just stuck there. It works kind of

# What's included

* Nullify 'extension' src

* Nullify 2.0 Bookmarklet src (skidded for readability)

* jVoid (InterVoid) Menu's src

* VoidMenu's Lesson Duper (patched since you can't open lesson iframes anymore, [html5iframe] was the lesson iframe)

* Void Menu 2.6 (doesn't work)

* Shadow/North Menu's src

* DevHaxx
  
* Sapphire will not be included here.
